Description of custom sorting algorithm
---------------------------------------
Implemented Pair-based Sorting.
In the approach, we would take a gap that starts at array length. Each time the length would decrease by 1/2.
We would then compare elements that are 'gap' away from each other. This process would continue until gap=1
or there is no swap needed.

Notes on using Copilot (or other AI)
------------------------------------
I have used chatGPT - It give me the idea of using this pair-based sorting and explained how the concepts worked.
